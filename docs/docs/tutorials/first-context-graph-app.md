# Your First Context Graph App

:::info Estimated time: 15-20 minutes
This includes project creation, Neo4j setup, data seeding, and exploration.
:::

This tutorial walks you through creating a context graph application from scratch, starting it up, and exploring its features. By the end, you will have a running app with a Neo4j knowledge graph, a FastAPI backend with an AI agent, and a Next.js frontend with graph visualization.

<!-- TODO: Replace with actual screenshot of the running app -->

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Python 3.11+** -- check with `python --version`
- **Node.js 18+** -- check with `node --version`
- **Docker** (optional) -- one option for running Neo4j locally. Alternatives: [Neo4j Aura](https://console.neo4j.io) (free cloud) or `@johnymontana/neo4j-local` (requires Node.js)
- **uv** (recommended) -- install with `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`

## Step 1: Create the Project

Run the CLI to launch the interactive wizard:

```bash
uvx create-context-graph
```

The wizard walks you through seven steps:

1. **Project name** -- enter a name like `my-health-app`
2. **Data source** -- generate demo data or connect SaaS integrations
3. **Domain** -- select from 22 built-in domains (e.g., Healthcare)
4. **Agent framework** -- choose your preferred framework (e.g., PydanticAI)
5. **Neo4j connection** -- for this tutorial, choose **Docker** (easiest if you have Docker installed) or **Neo4j Aura** (free cloud, no install). See the [Neo4j setup guides](/docs/how-to/use-docker) for all options.
6. **API keys** -- provide keys for your chosen agent framework
7. **Confirmation** -- review and confirm

The tool generates a complete project in your chosen directory.

### Non-Interactive Alternative

If you prefer to skip the wizard, pass all options as flags:

```bash
uvx create-context-graph my-health-app \
  --domain healthcare \
  --framework pydanticai \
  --demo-data
```

## Step 2: Start the App

Navigate to your new project and use the provided Makefile to get everything running:

```bash
cd my-health-app
```

**Install dependencies** for both the backend and frontend:

```bash
make install
```

**Start Neo4j** (depends on the option you selected):

```bash
# If using Docker:
make docker-up

# If using neo4j-local (no Docker required):
make neo4j-start

# If using Neo4j Aura or an existing instance: skip this step
```

For Docker, this launches a Neo4j container with the default credentials (`neo4j`/`password`). Wait a few seconds for it to become available.

**Seed the database** with your domain schema and demo data:

```bash
make seed
```

This creates the graph schema (constraints and indexes) and loads the fixture data into Neo4j.

**Start the application** (backend and frontend):

```bash
make start
```

## Step 3: Explore the App

With everything running, you have three interfaces to explore:

### Frontend -- http://localhost:3000

<!-- TODO: Replace with actual screenshot of the running frontend: ![Frontend three-panel layout with chat, graph, and documents](/img/screenshot-frontend.png) -->

The Next.js frontend provides a three-panel layout:

- **Chat interface** (left) -- talk to your AI agent using natural language. Responses stream in real-time: tool calls appear as a live timeline with spinner indicators as each executes, and text tokens appear incrementally. Conversations are multi-turn (the agent remembers what was discussed in the current session). Responses are rendered as markdown with formatted code, lists, and tables. Expand any tool call to see inputs and output details. Clickable demo scenario buttons get you started.
- **Context graph view** (center) -- an interactive NVL graph visualization showing entities and relationships. Nodes are color-coded by type. **Click any node** to open an entity detail panel showing all properties, labels, and connections.
- **Right panel with tabs:**
  - **Decision Traces** -- pre-seeded reasoning traces showing the agent's step-by-step thinking (thought, action, observation) with full outcomes.
  - **Documents** -- browse domain-specific documents (discharge summaries, trade confirmations, lab reports, etc.) with template type filtering. Click any document to read the full content with mentioned entity badges.

### Backend API -- http://localhost:8000/docs

The FastAPI backend exposes a Swagger UI with all available endpoints. Key routes include:

- `POST /chat` -- send a message to the agent (non-streaming)
- `POST /chat/stream` -- streaming chat via Server-Sent Events
- `GET /documents` -- list documents with optional template filter
- `GET /documents/{title}` -- full document content with mentioned entities
- `GET /traces` -- decision traces with full reasoning steps
- `GET /entities/{name}` -- full entity detail with properties and connections
- `POST /cypher` -- execute arbitrary Cypher queries

### Neo4j Browser -- http://localhost:7474

Connect to the Neo4j Browser to explore your graph directly. Use the default credentials (`neo4j`/`password`) and run Cypher queries. A good starting point:

```cypher
MATCH (n)-[r]->(m) RETURN n, r, m LIMIT 100
```

## Step 4: Try Demo Scenarios

Each domain comes with pre-built demo scenarios to showcase the agent's capabilities. For the healthcare domain, try these prompts in the chat interface:

**Patient lookup:**
- "Show me all patients currently diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes"
- "What medications is patient Johnson currently taking?"

**Clinical decision support:**
- "Are there any contraindicated medications in patient Chen's current prescriptions?"
- "What treatments have been most effective for similar patients with heart failure?"

**Provider network:**
- "Which cardiologists are affiliated with Memorial Hospital?"
- "Show the referral network for Dr. Johnson"

Watch the decision trace panel as the agent processes each query -- you will see it select tools, execute Cypher queries against Neo4j, and synthesize the results into a response.
